I hope that this project will be my first published Landing Page.

I plan to grow both my HTML and CSS skills with this project and continue to practice decent Git commit habits. 

Here is the start of many more pages to land on!

Day 2.33 (1 day, 8 hrs.):
1st Update: Now I've gotten a fairly good working version of the header. Getting the image to line up with the main text was the struggle of it all, I ended up fixing it by adding a/the image div ABOVE the text, from there it was just a matter of reversing the flexbox. I'm intersted to see how it holds up.

The next challange for the header is finding a good grow/shrink ratio + padding for the main text vs the image. I will be thinking about that in the background, but for now I'm going to move onto the rest of the page.
