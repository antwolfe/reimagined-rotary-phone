I hope that this project will be my first published Landing Page.

I plan to grow both my HTML and CSS skills with this project and continue to practice decent Git commit habits. 

Here is the start of many more pages to land on!

Day 2.33 (1 day, 8 hrs.):

1st Update: Now I've gotten a fairly good working version of the header. Getting the image to line up with the main text was the struggle of it all, I ended up fixing it by adding a/the image div ABOVE the text, from there it was just a matter of reversing the flexbox. I'm intersted to see how it holds up.

The next challange for the header is finding a good grow/shrink ratio + padding for the main text vs the image. I will be thinking about that in the background, but for now I'm going to move onto the rest of the page.

Day 3.33 (2 days, 8hrs) :

2nd Update: I'm getting hungry. Time has lost meaning and I've lost Wilson...

Wait..

I've gotten a working version going now. The major areas are in place and I'm feeling accomplished. There are some tweaks I want to make to how the page responds when the browser window is resized, but other than that I like how it is.

I learned today not to underestimate the power margins and padding and plan to look further into these during the next time I work on this page.

Just a couple more things to fix and look into before I do another. How exciting!

Update 3:
I am leaving this first draft the way it is, I believe there will be a chance to fix the things I want to fix in a later lesson.
